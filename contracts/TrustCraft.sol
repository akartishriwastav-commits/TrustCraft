    Constructor to initialize supply to deployer (owner)

    Transfer tokens

    See allowance of spender for owner

    Mint new tokens to an account (owner only)
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {

    Transfer ownership
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external onlyOwner {

        emit OwnershipTransferred(owner, newOwner);
        owner = newOwner;
